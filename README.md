# Transponder

No subscriptions, no lock in, no fragile interfaces. Own your training data by using the Traindown Transponder to record your sessions with the Traindown markup language. Traindown is a language to help athletes express their training that is inspired by Markdown.

## Getting Started

This is a Flutter project so here are a few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Currently there are two build targets--iOS and Android.
I have toyed around with the Desktop builds but haven't committed to it yet.
